#recorder_channel_id: IDs of each channel according to the raw file header. 
#    • For licel systems: provide the licel id per channel that is going to be include. Currently only BT and BC channels are supported.

#laser: mandatory only for licel systems. The ascending laser number according to the licel manual. Provide it to link with the licel file.

#Partly Optional Variables -- These variables take default values. It is highly recommended though to fill
#them in because  might not be valid for the system.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#daq_trigger_offset: Provide only if known, otherwise it defaults to 0. The offset of the data acquisition trigger with respect to the Q-switch per channel in bins. Provide negative values if the acquisition starts before the Q-switch (pre-triggering) and positive values if the acquisition starts after the Q-switch

#detected_wavelength:  The wavelength of the detected signal according to the applied Interference Filter of each channel (in nm). This variable is provided by default from the raw file metadata but if accuracy is required for molecular calculations the exact central wavelength should be provided.
detected_wavelength =

#emitted_wavelength: The wavelength of the originally emitted laser beam per channel. A very rough guess process is applied by default using that detected channel information that it is valid ONLY for Nd:Yag lasers with elastic and vibrational Raman channels. Please provide the values explicitly if your system does not fall in this category. Defaults to:
#    • 355 for channels with detected wavelength <520nm
#    • 532 for channels with detected wavelength <1000nm

#channel_bandwidth: Interference filter Bandwidth (in nm, Defaults to: 1nm). The default value is a very rough guess and it can easily lead to high uncertainty in the molecular depolarization value.
